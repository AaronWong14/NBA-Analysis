    "We are interested in basketball, not just the gameplay, but also the statistics that are behind everything. It is said that good teams have at least one superstar on them, someone who puts up stats that are higher than most other players. While coming up with a question, someone proposed the idea of what made a good team, and that we could base our question on that. However, we argued for a long time on what our basis should be - offense, or defense, or a bit of both. We then settled on analyzing arguably, the five most analyzed stats for each individual player: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals. We realize that although stats aren't everything, we will be taking the top eight teams each year since the 21st century, and see if there are any trends among teams or over the years.\n",

    "At first, we believed that researching basketball information would be easy; we would scrape data off of the NBA site using an api, or just taking it directly from their statistics page. However, we quickly realized that the NBA API is very closed, we need to register and authorize our account to get information. We believe that this API is mainly for scouters, or some other professionals hoping to recruit NBA players to their teams. With that, we jump to our next reliable source, Basketball-Reference. Basketball-Reference has all the stats we need, for every player, for every year. \n",

    "We then proceeded to think of ways to obtain that information; we could use beautifulsoup to scrape data off of the the tables and charts. We even looked through some github accounts. We then came across an API for the NBA on Github. This API uses Python and can be used to scrape stats of players; it can even go as far as to predicting who will make the All Star team, which only good impactful players can make. The list of parameters this API takes on is long, meaning that this API will have a lot of functionality; we could potentially use this API to compare teams.\n",

Along with that, we will compare the advanced stats of the top player such as offensive rating, defensive rating, and player efficiency rating.\n",
